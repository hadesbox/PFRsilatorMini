# PFRsilatorMini
Touchable synthesizer to support my makerspace


This project was made as a kickstarter pledge reward to donate to the makerspace that I operate out of.  The project is open source-open hardware released under a CC-BY-SA 4.0 licence, linked here: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/

The design is a glitchy quad oscillator with touch pads to control pitch and cross modulation.  Each oscillator has its own on/off switch to allow the oscillator to either make a steady tone or to only be audible when touching the oscillators pads.  The mix of all four oscillators goes out to a 1/4" jack, the synth can be powered by either a DC wallwart (5 - 12V positive tip) or a 9V battery.

Some notes on electrical safety concerning electrode-based synthesizers:

This synthesizer makes use of body electrodes that allow a small electronic current to flow through your body.  If used in a circumstance with faulty power this can cause electrical shocks resulting in pains, burns, and in extreme circumstances death.  USE THE PFRSILATOR MINI AT YOUR OWN RISK.  
Safest use of this synthesizer involves powering both the synth and the speakers using batteries.  A small portable speaker and use of a 9V with the battery snap are the ideal scenario.  If plugged into a wall using a serge protector for both the synthesizer and the speaker will minimize the current that can flow from the electrodes in a faulty power situation, such as from a power outage or a ground fault.  If using the PFRsilator mini on a large sound system the use of a DI/ Direct Inject box is highly encouraged.  Not only will it protect the user from shocks coming from a sound system that can provide hundreds to thousands of watts of power but it will also reduce hum in the audio output of the device.  For playing on a sound system use of a DI box and a surge protector (or battery power) are highly encouraged.  Furthermore, any large shocks caused by faulty power have a significantly lower chance of being fatal if the user is only using one hand on the electrodes.  This is because the power is only traveling through the hand and not across the chest, which can stop your heart.  Again, the end user is expected to follow instructions and minimize risk electric shock risk in all ways possible.
